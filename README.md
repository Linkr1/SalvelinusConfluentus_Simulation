# SalvelinusConfluentus_Simulation
In this project, we looked at a number of factors that might affect the stable co-existence of sneaker and territorial males using Bull Trout as a model. 
This folder contains two files: 
- The final dataset: a .csv file containing the reponse (metric of relative sneaker success) and explanatory variable (female mating preference, sneaker maturation, proportion of sneaker at initialization, and size mortality) for the simulation
- The R code used for the analyses.
